# Registro-Ciudadanos
Citizen registration:

The objective of the application is clarity when providing the user with a more useful, reliable and less complex way when filling out the fields in the citizen registration application focusing mainly on adults in an age range between 45 to 55 years old in the environment of the state of Yucatan and all its municipalities.

The objective of the system is to be able to perform a registration in a fast and understandable way for the aforementioned public, collecting their data in a reliable way, taking as reference points to change the points in which our test subjects had more time and stress points when completing the filling fields. 

Taking as reference systems the bank forms when registering a new user for a new bank account requiring personal data such as unique key as CURP, cell phone number, location of place of residence.

In new technologies we found an interactive map that has functionalities similar to those of a "Maps" application with the particularity that it has the registry and coordinates of each of the localities of the state of Yucatan and when locating a point in a locality it automatically fills in the attached fields including the district office of the locality.

Diving into the importance of the system we will understand that it is an application that can be used as a frame of reference and future uses for citizen records when making decisions in a democratic way as it could be future electoral elections.
