Scope: The citizen registration module to vote for the "Diseña tu
ciudad" platform will be tested:
https://citizen-merida-test.web.app/citizen-sign-up

Purpose: We want to observe what problems arise in the participants when
registering in the module described above.

Participants: Middle-aged people (45 to 55 years old) who can vote in
the municipality of Mérida, Yucatán.

Steps to survey the participant:

1.  Instructions for conducting the interview: The participant must be
    provided with a desktop computer that has the document containing
    the instructions for the participant open in a Google Chrome browser
    tab, which can be found in the following link:
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J2ppIX-Vo67fiwGu-xUDRe_auXVWxbd0c6OVpMIkpLA/edit?usp=sharing
2.  Once the user has entered the link provided in the instruction for
    the participant, the facilitator must begin to audio record the
    session and then use it to fill out the spreadsheet that will be
    used to save information about the session. In the spreadsheet you
    will find the following fields to fill out: The name of the
    participant, their age, the number of times they asked for help from
    the facilitator, if they finished the test or not, observations, and
    questions regarding the use that the participants make of some
    applications. As for the "completed" section, a 1 must be put if the
    participant finished to register and a 0 if not. Warning: If after
    20 minutes the participant can't finish to register, it must be
    taken as not concluded and move on with the following steps of the
    test. Regarding the" observations" section, all the questions that
    the participant asked should be recorded, whether they managed to
    complete the experiment or not, if they had an email to register,
    what elements they needed help with, why they needed help. Then we
    will evaluate the technological knowledge that the person has. We
    will do this by asking the person which functionalities they use
    from the Whatsapp and Google Maps app, below each question, a 1 must
    be put if the participant uses the functionality and a 0 if not.
    We'll get this information by asking the participant to answer the
    formulary that is described in the following step of this script.

3.  Once the participant has registered, the facilitator must ask them
    to answer questions regarding some aspects of the citizen register,
    the questions can be found in the following google forms:

after asking those questions, a one last formulary regarding the use
that they give to some apps must be taken, it can be found in the
following link to the google forms:

    will end and the recording will stop.
