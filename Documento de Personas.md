1. **Collect Data**

**Who are the users?**

Any person who is between 45 and 55 years old.

**How many users are there?**

According to the following census:

<https://telencuestas.com/censos-de-poblacion/mexico/2020/yucatan/merida> the number of people in that age range is about 129,413.

**What do they do with the system?**

Register to then vote for projects proposed in their district.

**Methods used**

The data collection process is described in:

<https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Ywg5WwXGqbe9LcaqfAW1JrhPEQa4BwY-Aho0IISanE/edit?usp=sharing>

**Documents produced**

A spreadsheet containing observations made by the facilitator in the time of the interview which can be found in the following link: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ozD2UgG1dL3U-CW0Ihn8scoldsvuOU6K4_DyM7NYnsU/edit?usp=sharing>

Other document is a Google Forms containing questions that are given to the user once registered, it can be found in the following link: <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdd4SlGNDwkxu06qK-FVpfAXSvHjoZP-_48U8rY867jnrfa-Q/viewform>

2. **Form a hypothesis**

**What are the differences among users?**

Use of digital applications: Whether they use digital applications on a daily basis

Use of interfaces map based applications: Whether they have experience and preference to previous map based interfaces or interactions.

Digital affinity: Whether they have multiple devices and interact with them in a daily basis.

Data privacy concerns: Whether they worry about privacy keeped while the system handles their data.

**Methods used**

With the information gathered on the survey, we can observe that the people who

doesn’t have experience with map based applications have a lot more chances of failing to register or to take more time than those who have it.

So we can group the users in terms of use of digital applications and use of map based applications. We will do this by evaluating the technological knowledge that the person has. We’ll ask if the person uses the WhatsApp application, if they use it then we’ll know that they have a medium knowledge of the use of applications, if they do not use it we will take it as having very basic or no knowledge. If the participant uses WhatsApp and has more than 3 devices, we will consider this person skilled in the use of technology. We will also be taking into account whether they use Google Maps or some other Geographic Information System to find an address. In the columns “Uses WhatsApp”, “Has 3 or more devices” and “Does know how to use Google Maps or some other GIS” a “1” must be put in the case where it is met.

With that we intend to group the people as:

**Inexperienced**: People who don't use whatsapp.

**Medium experience:** People who use whatsapp and don't have more than 3 devices.

**High experience:** People who use whatsapp and have more than 3 devices.

**Map based application experienced:** People who uses Google maps or any other application that has a map based interface to locate an ubication.

3. **Ensure everyone accepts the hypothesis**

**a)Questions asked**

**Data of personas:** Users mainly disliked having interacted with a map that lacks locations or points of location characteristic of their area or place where they live. They needed to be located with strategic points of reference that are placed on the map such as logos or names of shopping centers, names or visualization of green areas such as parks, differentiating the colors of what is a private and a public location or colors to separate streets from houses.

**Data for situations:** In a desktop registration environment, users who lacked a mouse and had only a laptop trackpad found it difficult to scroll to find the other fields to fill in the registration form.

**Data for Scenarios:**In order for users to achieve successful registration to be able to carry out the vote we need to improve 2 main points which are the overview of the map to be accessed and the way the scroll sidebar is displayed for users to visualize where they can interact with the page to be able to position themselves and find the different fields to fill in to advance and complete the registration.

**b) Methods used:**

**Qualitative data collection:** Via google forms we captured some qualitative data on the forms about the users level of concern with the privacy with which their data was handled, how pleasant was the interaction with the map and the reasonableness regarding the amount of information requested on the clients form.

**c) Documents produced:**

**Descriptions of categories:**

**Inexperienced**: People who don't use whatsapp.

**Medium experience:** People who use whatsapp and don't have more than 3 devices.

**High experience:** People who use whatsapp and have more than 3 devices.

**Map based application experienced:** People who uses Google maps or any other application that has a map based interface to locate an ubication.

4. **Establish a number of personas**

**a)Questions asked**

**Does the initial grouping hold?**

We decided to group the citizens who voted by age instead of experience because the initial grouping doesn't really helps to determine the problems of our target groups.

**Are there other groups to consider?** There are other groups like the district groups.

**Are all equally important?** The users with an age of 45 - 55 years old are more important than the rest.

**b)Methods used:**

We can categorize the users on age groups:

**Elderly users:** 60+ years.

**Middle-aged Adults users :** users with an age between the 40 - 59 years range.

**Adults users:** 20 - 39 years

**Young users**: 10 - 19 years.

**Construct and describe your personas**

a)Questions asked

Middle-aged Adults users:

	Name: Tomás
