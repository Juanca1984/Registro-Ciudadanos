**Documents produced**

A spreadsheet containing observations made by the facilitator in the time of the interview which can be found in the following link: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ozD2UgG1dL3U-CW0Ihn8scoldsvuOU6K4_DyM7NYnsU/edit?usp=sharing>

Other document is a Google Forms containing questions that are given to the user once registered, it can be found in the following link: <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdd4SlGNDwkxu06qK-FVpfAXSvHjoZP-_48U8rY867jnrfa-Q/viewform>

2. **Form a hypothesis**

**What are the differences among users?**

Use of digital applications: Whether they use digital applications on a daily basis

Use of interfaces map based applications: Whether they have experience and preference to previous map based interfaces or interactions.

Digital affinity: Whether they have multiple devices and interact with them in a daily basis.

Data privacy concerns: Whether they worry about privacy keeped while the system handles their data.

**Methods used**

With the information gathered on the survey, we can observe that the people who

doesn’t have experience with map based applications have a lot more chances of failing to register or to take more time than those who have it.

So we can group the users in terms of use of digital applications and use of map based applications. We will do this by evaluating the technological knowledge that the person has. We’ll ask if the person uses the WhatsApp application, if they use it then we’ll know that they have a medium knowledge of the use of applications, if they do not use it we will take it as having very basic or no knowledge. If the participant uses WhatsApp and has more than 3 devices, we will consider this person skilled in the use of technology. We will also be taking into account whether they use Google Maps or some other Geographic Information System to find an address. In the columns “Uses WhatsApp”, “Has 3 or more devices” and “Does know how to use Google Maps or some other GIS” a “1” must be put in the case where it is met.

With that we intend to group the people as:

**Inexperienced**: People who don't use whatsapp.

**Medium experience:** People who use whatsapp and don't have more than 3 devices.

**High experience:** People who use whatsapp and have more than 3 devices.

**Map based application experienced:** People who uses Google maps or any other application that has a map based interface to locate an ubication.
